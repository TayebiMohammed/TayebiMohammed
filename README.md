👋 Hi, I’m @TayebiMohammed
👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence, generative modeling, and optimization, particularly in applying AI and statistical methods to tackle complex real-world problems.
🌱 I’m currently advancing my work in AI with a focus on generative models (such as GANs and VAEs) and exploring optimization techniques using metaheuristic algorithms.
💼 I hold a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, and I enjoy leveraging mathematical theories and algorithms to create innovative AI solutions.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to imbalanced data handling, fraud detection, and optimization, especially with experts or teams exploring generative modeling and ensemble learning.
📫 You can reach me at moha28tabi@gmail.com or via my ResearchGate profile.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I’m passionate about transforming theoretical models into impactful AI applications, bridging the gap between academia and industry.
